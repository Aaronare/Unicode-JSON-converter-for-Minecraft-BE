Minecraft BE JSON (Unicode) Converter/Encoder

🔹 Protect Your Minecraft Addon JSON Code!
Are you a Minecraft Bedrock addon creator worried about your JSON files being taken and used without permission? This JSON (Unicode) Converter/Encoder helps secure your addon’s JSON code by encoding it into a less readable format while remaining fully functional in Minecraft. While this method offers some protection, it is highly recommended to use additional obfuscation techniques for better security.

🔧 How to Use the Tool:
Using this tool is simple! Follow these steps to encode your JSON files:

1️⃣ Choose your JSON file or manually copy and paste your JSON code into the input text field.
2️⃣ Click the "Convert" button.
3️⃣ The encoded JSON code will be generated and displayed below.
4️⃣ Click the "Copy" button to copy the encoded JSON to your clipboard.
5️⃣ Paste the encoded JSON into your Minecraft Behavior or Resource Pack files—and you're good to go! 🚀

By following these steps, you can make it more difficult for others to directly copy and modify your JSON files without permission.

⚠️ Important Disclaimer
Back up your original JSON files before encoding to prevent data loss.
This tool provides basic protection, but it is not a foolproof security measure—for better protection, consider additional obfuscation techniques.
👨‍💻 Credits & Source Code
This JSON Encoder tool was created by Aaron Gamer, who developed both the UI and the encoding system. The full source code will be released soon, allowing developers to explore and improve upon the tool.
